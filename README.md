Weekly Challenge #3

Did I do it right?



Description of project:

This week, you will be making a website! A built in feature of GitHub, called “GitHub Pages”, allows you to host a website from a repository! The process is fairly simple:
1. Make a new repository.
2. Make a website. This may be as involved as you want; however, ensure that an “index.html” ﬁle exists as the homepage.
3. Add the website to the repository. Ideally, place it in it’s own branch named “gh-pages”; however, this is ﬂexible.
4. Go to the website “USER.github.io/REPO”, where “USER” is your GitHub username, and “REPO” is the name of your repository.

NOTE! The “REPO” is case sensitive. Thus, if your repository is named “SoftwareCarpentry”, and your username is “garyBerry”, the website would be “https://garyBerry.github.io/SoftwareCarpentry”.
